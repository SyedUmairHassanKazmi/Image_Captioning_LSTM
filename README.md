# Image_Captioning_LSTM
 
 Author =  Syed Umair Hassan Kazmi
 
This was built and run in kaggle    
flickr 30k dataset was used   
Used Resnet 50 to get image features     
Used Tensor flow data pipeline for image preprocessing    
Used LSTM model to predict the captions    
Achieved 89.* % Validation Accuracy

Will try to use glove vectors next time     
will try to use efficientnetB7 next time     
will try to use transformer network next time     

The code is in the Image_Captioning_LSTM.ipynb file    
The code to run this on web browser for predicting in in app.py file    
test.py was to debug/check python part of code in app.py
