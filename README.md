# Image_Captioning_LSTM
 
 Author =  Syed Umair Hassan Kazmi
 
This was built and run in kaggle
flickr 30k dataset was used
Used Resnet 50 to get image features  
Used Tensor flow data pipeline for image preprocessing
Used LSTM model to predict the captions
Achieved 90% Validation Accuracy
-----------------------

-----------------------

Will try to use glove vectors next time
will try to use efficientnetB7 next time
will try to use transformer network next time

The code is in the Image_Captioning_LSTM.ipynb file
The code to run this on web browser for predicting in in app.py file
